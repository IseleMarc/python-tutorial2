    "# 5. Functions\n",
    "Here, we will have a short look at functions. Functions are a neat way to clean up your code and make it easier to overview the whole picture. You can also import functions from modules (as we have done before with the numpy.arange() function).<br>\n",
    "You can also write your own modules and import them yourself. You can do this in one of two ways:\n",
    "* Either you have said own module inside the folder, where you execute the script/import-command/whatever\n",
    "* or: you can have your modules stored in a specific folder. Python of course will not know where to look for this folder at first. The *sys* module has a list *path* (execute *import sys* and *print(sys.path)*) in which all paths are stored. You can alter this list:\n",
    "    * with the *append* function: *sys.path.append(/path/to/modules/)*.\n",
    "    * in a more permanent way by changing the *PYTHONPATH* [environment variable](https://phoenixts.com/blog/environment-variables-in-linux/) in your *.bashrc* file in your homefolder (*~/.bashrc*) with the command: *export PYTHONPATH='/path/to/modules'*. Changing things in the *.bashrc* can be really useful, read up here ([german link](https://wiki.ubuntuusers.de/Bash/bashrc/))"
