# python-tutorial

A quick tutorial towards python. Written in jupyter-notebook.

You can execute the files by typing "jupyter-notebook 'filename'" which will start a new jupyter-notebook server on your machine and will open the notebook in firefox. Alternatively, you can just start a new session by typing "jupyter-notebook" without a filename and navigate to the file with the filebrowser inside the notebook.

It would be best if you'd copy the tutorial to your machine.
